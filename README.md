# Sports-Colpmex-System-Backend

# PUSL3190
This is my final year individual project done in 2024.

# Requirements
1. PHP: Laravel requires PHP. You should have PHP installed on your system. The recommended version is PHP 7.4 or higher, although Laravel may work with earlier versions as well.
2. Composer: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Laravel utilizes Composer to manage its dependencies. Make sure Composer is installed on your system.
3. Database: Laravel supports database MySQLSQL Server. You need to have your preferred database server installed and configured. Ensure that you have the necessary drivers installed and enabled in your PHP configuration.
4. Node.js and NPM (Optional): If your Laravel application utilizes front-end React technology, you'll need to have Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed to manage and install JavaScript dependencies.
5. Operating System Compatibility: Laravel can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux-based systems. Ensure that your operating system is compatible and meets the Laravel system requirements.
6. IDE or Text Editor: While not strictly required, having an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor configured for PHP development can greatly enhance your productivity when working with Laravel.
